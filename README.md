## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
This code needs python 3 or latest in order to be executed and was developed jupyter notebook using existing python libraries.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
We had four python scripts (robot.py, maze.py, tester.py and showmaze.py) scripts shared on the link https://www.google.com/url?q=https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2022/December/6391603b_ai-startercode/ai-startercode.zip&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1721000325200440&usg=AOvVaw03Iq0bw_3uge_iYEZ5bUUp
together with test_maze.txt files - mazes where the robot was tested on.

The implementation and development of the project covers the below topics:
	Data Exploration
	Exploratory Vizualization
	Benchmark
	Data Preprocessing
	Free-Form Visualization
	Improvement

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
A robot.py notebook, main part of the project, with comments has been created in order to come up with responses to the above topics. In order to execute and see how the robot nagivate either of the three mazes, run python tester.py test_maze_01.txt
command. To see how any of mazes look, please execute python showmaze.py test_maze_01.txt or python showmaze.py test_maze_02.txt or python showmaze.py test_maze_03.txt depending on which one you want to see the visualization of.

## Results<a name="results"></a>
The robot's best score after intensive training and a number of times modifictions, is 30 with 157 moves in 1st run and 25 moves in 2nd run. Had there been more time spend on the project, the score would have improved significantly.
